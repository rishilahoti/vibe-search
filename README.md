# Vibe Search 🔮

Vibe Search is a modern, AI-powered property discovery platform built with Next.js. Instead of using traditional filters, users can describe their ideal property's "vibe" in natural language to find places that truly match their lifestyle and energy.

## ✨ About The Project

This project revolutionizes property searching by moving away from rigid checkboxes and dropdowns. It leverages a semantic search backend (powered by Google Gemini) to understand the user's intent and feeling behind their query. The frontend is a sleek, visually engaging experience with a chat-style interface, dynamic backgrounds, and interactive result cards.

The core idea is simple: **Don't search, just describe.**

## 🚀 Key Features

-   **🤖 AI-Powered Semantic Search**: Users can input natural language queries like "a serene mountain retreat for yoga" or "a vibrant beachfront house for parties" to find relevant properties.
-   **💬 Interactive Chat UI**: A modern, chat-based interface for a more intuitive and engaging search experience.
-   **✨ Dynamic & Animated Frontend**:
    -   A procedural WebGL animated background (`DarkVeil`) creates an immersive atmosphere.
    -   `SpotlightCard` components provide a cool hover effect that follows the user's cursor.
    -   Animated gradient text and badges add a polished, premium feel.
-   **✅ Detailed & Relevant Results**: Each property card displays key information, including a relevance score, the reasons it matches the user's vibe, and descriptive tags.
-   **⚡️ Serverless Backend**: The search logic is handled by a Next.js API route, making the application fast and scalable.
