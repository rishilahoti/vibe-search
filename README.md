## ‚ú® About The Project

Vibe Search is an interactive Next.js application that helps users discover real estate properties based on descriptive "vibes" (e.g., "beach property in Goa", "mountain retreat", "farmhouse investment").
It combines a search API, AI-driven property matching, and modern UI components with animations and effects to deliver a delightful user experience.
